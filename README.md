# Various-Scripts

- ups_check.sh is to monitor my ups battery state and shutdown if lower than x percentage. sure nut-server has this build in but way of an overkill for my needs so a quick script I can cron with a basic nut installation and manage shutdown when battery low.

- playrandommp3.sh pick random mp3 files from a folder and play with mpg123. using it for a halloween project to play random horror sounds based on motion to scare the begeezus out of the kids
